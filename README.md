# CryptoClustering
- This repo contains one jupyter notebook, one folder containing a `csv` file/data, besides this markdown file. A jupyter notebook template was originally provided, which I followed in order to answer the questions. All code was written by me.
- I also wrote this code for cloning this repository to my local computer: (base) PS C:\Users\mrindfleisch\Desktop\Analysis Projects\assignments\module19> git clone https://github.com/MattRind/CryptoClustering.git
- Code for changing file name: `mv Crypto_Clustering_starter_code.ipynb Crypto_Clustering.ipynb`
